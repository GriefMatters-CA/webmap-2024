I introduce the idea of finding peers/grief buddies as a space to share and witness our sibling grief stories. Zines can be a simple way to process sibling grief with purpose and a pencil in hand. Having shared the fun of creating one-paged zines with siblings online and in-person peer grief support groups in North America, Grief Gatherings participants will learn simple visual storytelling techniques and how to create their own zine. Event-goers do not have to be writers or artists; 'stick people' and their unique voice are encouraged!
