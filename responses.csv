This day-long public symposium will bring together a keynote speaker, Dr. Lauren Breen, who helped develop the concept of grief literacy, and 15 presenters who will share current research, lived experience, and best practices on the themes of grief, loss, and resiliency. The Symposium will be organized as a series of moderated roundtables that promote the active exchange of knowledge among an interdisciplinary group of scholars, practitioners, students, and community members. Participants will engage in a public dialogue about youth-led grief activism, grief and loss among emerging adults, and loss, grief, and resiliency on our campus and in the community. Through these discussions, we will collectively explore ways to build more compassionate communities (Breen et al., 2022) that are responsive to grief in its many forms.

The one-day Symposium will be concluded with a public Photovoice Exhibit and the sharing of findings of a participatory arts-based research project conducted with Yazidi women in London, Ontario. The Photovoice Exhibit will highlight many of the core themes discussed throughout the day’s activities and will enrich the public’s understanding of the unique forms of loss experienced by refugees and displaced persons as well as the strength and resiliency Yazidis draw upon as they re-make their lives in Canada.",In-person,Kenny Theatre,266 Epworth Avenue,London,Ontario,N6A 2M3,Not sure,They should register,https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/grief-literacy-symposium-tickets-919282076437,Lisa McLean lmclea43@uwo.ca,Free,,,9/19/2024,8:45 AM EST,6:00:00 PM,Eastern Daylight Time (EDT),na,,,,,https://griefmatters.ca/schedule#calendar-76d0bbd3-3e15-4c91-a75b-9f2684318e83-event-m0bbadx9,https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/grief-literacy-symposium-tickets-919282076437,266 Epworth Avenue London Ontario N6A 2M3 Canada,43.0124722,-81.2571159,
